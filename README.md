# EventTicketTester - ITCR Programming Languages Course Project (2024)

This repository contains a preliminary test application developed in Python for the event ticket purchasing system project, part of the Programming Languages course at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR) during the second semester of 2024. This application serves as the initial deliverable to validate core functionalities and provide a proof of concept for the system.

### Project Details:

- Course: Programming Languages (2024)
- Institution: Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR)
- Duration: 15 days
- Technology: Python
- Scope: Develop a test application to simulate and validate basic functionalities of the event ticket purchasing system. This includes testing user
- account management, event listings, and transaction processes.
- Server: The server-side implementation, which will be developed in Rust, is part of a separate repository.

### Purpose:
This Python application is designed to:

- Demonstrate initial functionality of the ticket purchasing system.
- Serve as a proof of concept before the full implementation in Rust.
- Validate core features and provide a foundation for further development.
